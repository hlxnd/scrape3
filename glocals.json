			"description": "A quiet, sunny and really nice apartment of 50m2, fully-furnished and equipped in the limit of Ambilly/Annemasse (location: Croix d'Ambilly). Really close to bus station with several buses going to Moellesulaz (among them the bus 61 which goes to gare Cornavin in 30 minutes. FYI Moellesulaz is 15 minutes walking distance, so really short trip bus), and really close to next tram station between Annemasse and Geneva (end of work October/November 2019). Annemasse train station is at 10 minutes walking distance, which will give a direct access to Geneva airport and Cornavin train station with CEVA/Leman Express in December 2019. <br />\r\nThe flat is composed of one bed room with a double bed (140 x 200), one big living room (lounge and diner areas), one closed kitchen, and a bathroom with bathtub/shower, toilets and washing machine. As said the kitchen is fully equipped, the room and the leaving room are furnished. All rooms and kitchen are really sunny, with glazed doors which give access to a large terrace of 50m2. The place is quiet because the road just in front is a one way street that only gives access to houses around and to the residence where the flat is. The main road is a bit aside so the noise is not direct and the apartment really enjoyable.<br />\r\nA small cellar (4m2) is included in the lease.<br />\r\nIn the residence there’s a private free parking, closed by a gate.<br />\r\nMany supermarkets around and the center of Annemasse is accessible in less than 10 minutes (walking distance).<br />\r\nThe price does not include water and electricity (electricity, based on figures of current tenant, is less than 90 euros per month and water, also based on figures of current tenant, around 10/15 euros per month). <br />\r\nThe flat will be available 1st of May 2019.<br />\r\nDo not hesitate to ask for videos that gives a true idea of this really nice apartment.",

			"description": "Hi there, <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am renting my room for 8 weeks from mid-June to mid-August while I go travel the world. It comes fully furbished (including linen, towels, kitchen equipment, etc.) and the price includes all charges/bills. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe flat is shared with one more person, a French female keen to improve her English. The bathroom, loo, fully equipped kitchen, living room and large balcony are shared. The whole flat is newly furbished, kept very clean and (we like to think) nicely decorated. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nConveniently located in Eaux-Vives, 5 minutes walk from the lake in very quiet settings (both living room and bedroom oversee the trees). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany public transports are in a 2-minutes walking range (TPG lines 1, 2, 6, 9, 12) as well as shops, restaurants and a lovely park where there are free concerts in the summer! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA female renter would be preferred. While it is not possible to rent for only part of the 8 weeks, a slight extension (earlier arrival date and/or later departure) is envisageable. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't hesitate to write to me for more information. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest,<br />\r\nNoemi",

The one bedroom house all made in dry local stones offers a king size bed, a fully equipped kitchen, a design bathroom and outdoor terraces surrounded by land, cactuses and olive trees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Pajara was built by the local farmers and it was used during the tobacco season in the summer. The flat roof was used to dry figs and tomatoes for the winter. Farmers lived in it until the fifties. <br />\r\nIt is located inside the Otranto-Leuca Coastal Natural Park and is surrounded by spectacular olive trees and cactus pears plant.  You can walk freely to the old medieval tower on top of the hill and overlooking the sea and bike to the village main square and shops, and to Acquaviva, a beach cove only 2km away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Geneva there are direct EasyJet and Swiss flights to Brindisi airport (90km away).

Bike parking in front of the building too.<br />\r\nThe room is very big, nice with a privet balcony with a nice view on the city.<br />\r\nThe flatmate is a positive, flexible, young and nice girl, professional, happy to meet you too. If you are looking for a nice and comfortable house to live in not alone, this is our beautiful place.<br />\r\nApartment is located in residential, calm and green district of St Jean, Rue d' Ermenonville.
